**PS4:** Due Sat Nov 2 at 5:00PM Central. Worth 100 points. 
### Academic integrity statement
We checked Googled commands/ways to go about getting the output needed. I have included the links where I learned from. Additionally, I used ChatGPT for help with debugging double checking the flow of my code.  I also referred to code from last quarter's python class for grouping, datetime, dictionary, length, float, round, print,a nd reset index functinos. ALso checked https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/geospatial for specific codign questions.

```{python}
# Load the 2016 dataset
df = pd.read_csv(
    'C:/Users/clari/OneDrive/Documents/Python II/pos_files/pos2016.csv')
# change the path as needed
```

```{python}
# Filter for short-term hospitals (provider type code 01 and subtype code 01)
st_hospitals_2016 = df[(df['PRVDR_CTGRY_CD'] == 1) &
                       (df['PRVDR_CTGRY_SBTYP_CD'] == 1)]
print(len(st_hospitals_2016))
```

    a.There are 7,245 reported in this data.This number doesn't make sense because there seem to be too many short-term hospitals.
    b. According to AHA, there were only 4,840 in 2016, so this number doesn't make sense. This could be due to differences in
     definitions, inclusion criteria, and scope. Maybe this raw dataset  has a broader range of facilities certified for Medicare/Medicaid billing, which increases the cout. Maybe the includsion of subtypes increased our count too.

3. 
```{python}
# Define the path to your folder containing the POS files
folder_path = r'C:/Users/clari/OneDrive/Documents/Python II/pos_files'

# List all files in the directory to check if they exist
print("Files in directory:")
for file in os.listdir(folder_path):
    print(file)

# Define a function to load CSV files with different encodings and filter for short-term hospitals


def load_and_filter_csv(file_name, encodings, year):
    for encoding in encodings:
        try:
            # Try reading the file with a specified encoding
            df = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(folder_path, file_name),
                             encoding=encoding, engine='python')
            print(f'Successfully loaded {file_name} with encoding {encoding}.')

            # Filter for short-term hospitals (provider type code 01 and subtype code 01)
            st_hospitals = df[(df['PRVDR_CTGRY_CD'] == 1) &
                              (df['PRVDR_CTGRY_SBTYP_CD'] == 1)]
            # Add a 'Year' column to the DataFrame
            st_hospitals['Year'] = year

            return st_hospitals  # Return the filtered DataFrame if loaded successfully
        except Exception as e:
            print(f'Error loading {file_name} with encoding {encoding}: {e}')
    return None  # Return None if all attempts fail


# List of encodings to try
encodings = ['utf-8', 'ISO-8859-1', 'latin1', 'utf-8-sig', 'cp1252']

# List of file names and corresponding years
files_with_years = [('pos2016.csv', 2016), ('pos2017.csv', 2017),
                    ('pos2018.csv', 2018), ('pos2019.csv', 2019)]

# Load datasets for all years and filter for short-term hospitals
appended_dfs = []
for file_name, year in files_with_years:
    df = load_and_filter_csv(file_name, encodings, year)
    if df is not None:
        appended_dfs.append(df)

# Check if we successfully loaded and filtered data for all years
if len(appended_dfs) == len(files_with_years):
    # Append all filtered DataFrames together into one DataFrame
    combined_df = pd.concat(appended_dfs, ignore_index=True)
    print("Successfully appended all datasets.")

    # Save the combined DataFrame to a CSV file named 'pos_6789.csv'
    output_file = os.path.join(folder_path, 'pos_6789.csv')
    combined_df.to_csv(output_file, index=False)
    print(f"Combined dataset saved as {output_file}")
else:
    print("Some files could not be loaded or filtered.")

# Optionally, print the first few rows of the combined DataFrame to verify
if len(appended_dfs) > 0:
    print(combined_df.head())
```

There was a utf-8 error, so I asked chatGPT how to fix it 
```{python}
combined_df = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(folder_path, 'pos_6789.csv'))

# Group by 'Year' and count the number of rows per year
hospitals_by_year = combined_df.groupby('Year').size()

# Plotting the number of hospitals by year
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
hospitals_by_year.plot(kind='bar', color='lightcoral')
plt.title('Number of Hospitals by Year')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Number of Hospitals')
plt.xticks(rotation=0)
plt.show()
```

4. 
    a.
```{python}
unique_hospitals_by_year = combined_df.groupby('Year')['PRVDR_NUM'].nunique()

# Plotting the number of unique hospitals by year
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
unique_hospitals_by_year.plot(kind='bar', color='lightcoral', edgecolor='black')
plt.title('Number of Unique Hospitals by Year', fontsize=16)
plt.xlabel('Year', fontsize=14)
plt.ylabel('Number of Unique Hospitals', fontsize=14)
plt.xticks(rotation=0)
plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

    b.Both plots (total vs. unique hospitals) give the same result. This strongly suggests that the  dataset is clean and well-structured, with no duplicate entries for hospitals based on their CMS certification numbers (PRVDR_NUM). Each hospital appears only once per year, which means I can confidently proceed with further analysis without worrying about duplicate data affecting your results.
